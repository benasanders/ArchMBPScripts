# ArchMBPScripts
Scripts to install arch on my MBP

I wrote this myself for myself, but help yourself to it I guess. You probably don't want it.
It is explicitly for my mbp 11,1
It creates my user name bsanders
It installs all of MY programs and shit
I need to change line endings from dos. Right now I'm downloading the scripts first, then converting. PITA.

I am only here because trying to curl or wget from google drive is balls
